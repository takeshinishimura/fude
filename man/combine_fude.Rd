\title{Combine the Fude Polygon data with the agricultural community boundary data}
\usage{
combine_fude(
  data,
  boundary,
  city,
  old_village = "",
  community = "",
  year = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{List of \code{\link[sf:sf]{sf::sf()}} objects.}

\item{boundary}{List of one or more agricultural community boundary data provided by
the MAFF.}

\item{city}{A local government name in Japanese to be extracted. In the case of
overlapping local government names, the prefecture name must be included
(e.g., Fuchu-shi). Alternatively, it could be a local government code.}

\item{old_village}{String by regular expression. One or more old village name in Japanese to
be extracted.}

\item{community}{String by regular expression. One or more agricultural community name in
Japanese to be extracted.}

\item{year}{Year in the column name of the \code{data}, if there is more than one
applicable local government code.}

\description{
\code{combine_fude()} uses the agricultural community boundary data to reduce the
Fude Polygon data to the community units.
