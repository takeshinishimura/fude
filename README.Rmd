The fude package provides utilities to facilitate handling of Fude Polygon data downloadable from the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF) website. The word "fude" ("ç­†") is a Japanese counter suffix used when referring to land parcels.

## Get Data

Download the Fude Polygon data from the following release site of MAFF (only Japanese is available).

- <https://open.fude.maff.go.jp>

## Installation

You can install the released version of fude from CRAN with:

``` r
install.packages("fude")
```

Or the development version from GitHub with:

```{r eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("takeshinishimura/fude")
```

## Usage

You can let R read the downloaded ZIP file without unzipping it.
This function was inspired by [kokudosuuchi: Utilities for 'Kokudo Suuchi'](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=kokudosuuchi).

```{r example}
library(fude)

d <- read_fude("~/2022_382019.zip")
```

Those who wish to use a mouse or trackpad for file selection, which is especially common among R beginners, can do the following.

```{r eval = FALSE}
d <- read_fude(file.choose())
```

You can change the local government code to the Japanese municipality name for easier handling.

```{r}
d <- rename_fude(d)
```
